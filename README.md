# Odin Recipes

Welcome to **Odin Recipes**, a simple recipe website built using HTML. This project is part of my journey to learn web development fundamentals, focusing on HTML structure, linking pages, and organizing content. The website features a collection of recipes, each with its own page containing descriptions, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

## About the Project
This project is a static website created using **HTML**. It serves as a platform to display various recipes in an organized and visually appealing way. The website is designed to be simple, easy to navigate, and accessible to everyone.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into iterations, each adding new features and content to the website:

### **Iteration 1: Initial Structure**
- Created the `index.html` file as the homepage.
- Added a boilerplate HTML structure and an `<h1>` heading: **"Odin Recipes"**.

### **Iteration 2: Recipe Page**
- Created a `recipes` directory to store individual recipe pages.
- Added a new HTML file for each recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`).
- Included a boilerplate HTML structure and an `<h1>` heading with the recipe name.
- Linked the recipe page to the homepage (`index.html`) and added a link back to the homepage on the recipe page for easier navigation.

### **Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content**
- Added an image of the finished dish under the `<h1>` heading.
- Included a **Description** section with a paragraph describing the recipe.
- Added an **Ingredients** section with an unordered list of ingredients.
- Added a **Steps** section with an ordered list of instructions for making the dish.

### **Iteration 4: Add More Recipes**
- Added two more recipe pages with the same structure as the first.
- Updated the homepage (`index.html`) to include links to all recipes in an unordered list for better organization.
